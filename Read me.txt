This project was made for Autonomous robotics course.

There are three folders containing:

Folder No. 1: For the First Problem given to us which was to compute the error of the odometry in a translation only movement.

Folder No. 2: For the Second Problem given to us which was to compute the error of the odometry in a rotation only movement.

Folder No. 3: For the Third Problem given to us which was to compute the error of the odometry in a combined movement.

The code is being pasted in a text file in both the folders to have a quick look on it.

Thank you.
